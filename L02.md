# Concept Notes on Blockchain Technology (Class 2)

## Overview
- **Focus:** Designing solutions for decentralized architectures, specifically in the context of supply chain management.
- **Key Topics:**
  - Decentralization with blockchain
  - Fundamental properties of blockchain
  - Formal definition of blockchain

## Recap of Decentralization
- In a decentralized architecture, multiple stakeholders do not trust each other but need to coordinate.
- Effective coordination can enhance visibility and efficiency in business operations.

## Designing a Decentralized Solution
### Problem Statement
- Multiple stakeholders in a supply chain need to coordinate and share information transparently.
- A solution must allow stakeholders to submit and verify information without a central authority.

### Concept of a "Blackboard"
- Imagine a blackboard where all stakeholders can write information permanently.
- Example: A stakeholder records the production of crude oil, and distributors log transportation details.
- This blackboard allows for tracking and verification of the entire supply chain process.

### Properties of the Blackboard
1. **Infinite Space:** Historical information is preserved; no need to erase old data.
2. **Visibility:** All stakeholders can see the information, ensuring transparency.
3. **Change Tracking:** Any corrections must be noted without erasing previous entries, maintaining a clear record of changes.
4. **Immutability:** Once information is written, it cannot be erased, preventing denial of actions taken.

### Advantages of the Blackboard Concept
- Simplifies auditing processes; discrepancies can be easily identified.
- Facilitates real-time information sharing among stakeholders.
- Enables automated analysis of data for better decision-making.

## Challenges of Centralized Solutions
- A centralized entity maintaining the blackboard poses risks, such as data breaches or manipulation.
- Centralized systems are vulnerable to attacks, making them less secure.

## Transition to Decentralization
- Instead of a single blackboard, each stakeholder maintains their own copy of the blackboard.
- This decentralized architecture ensures that no single entity controls the information.

### Ensuring Consistency
- A challenge arises in ensuring that all copies of the blackboard contain the same information.
- This leads to the concept of the **distributed consensus problem**, which ensures all stakeholders have a consistent view of the data.

## Introduction to Blockchain
- **Definition:** A blockchain is an immutable, append-only, ever-growing chain of data.
- **Key Properties:**
  - **Decentralized:** No single entity controls the data; all stakeholders maintain their own copies.
  - **Immutable:** Data cannot be deleted or modified once added.
  - **Append-Only:** New data can only be added, not erased.
  - **Public Ledger:** Information is accessible to all stakeholders, promoting transparency.

### Structure of Blockchain
- Each stakeholder maintains a local copy of the blockchain.
- New information is added in the form of blocks, which are appended to the existing chain.
- A consensus mechanism ensures that all copies of the blockchain remain synchronized.

## Conclusion
- Blockchain technology provides a robust framework for decentralized applications beyond cryptocurrencies.
- The properties of blockchain enhance transparency, security, and efficiency in various business applications.
- Future classes will cover fundamental cryptographic techniques used in blockchain design and the structure of blocks and chains.

### Next Steps
- Upcoming classes will delve into cryptographic techniques and the overall design of blockchain systems.
- Understanding these concepts will further clarify how blockchain can be applied effectively in real-world scenarios.
